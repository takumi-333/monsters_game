# monsters_game
This is "monsters  game" made by Unity

### Abstract
This game is a monster-raising and battling game. 
Raise the level of your monsters, make them your allies, and train your own party. 

This is the first project I've created using Unity, so there are many rough parts, but I hope you can overlook them.

### How To Play

Please download the Windows or Mac zip file from the release notes and try playing it on your computer.
